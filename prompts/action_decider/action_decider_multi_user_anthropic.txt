Here's the accessibility tree of the current web page:
<accessibility_tree>
$ax_tree
</accessibility_tree>

Your task is:
<task>
$task
</task>

Here's the memory of actions you've taken so far:
<action_memory>
$action_memory
</action_memory>

Remember:
- Every action in the accessibility tree is labeled with a number at the start of the line.
- Some actions have the text SPECIAL ACTION after their number, pay attention to these and choose them when appropriate. These are found at the top of the accessibility tree.
- The action_memory is an enumerated list of tuples in the format:
   - x) Location: Where was taken
     x) Effect: Effect of action
   - Later items in action_memory happened more recently.
- If the user doesn't give specify specific attributes, use the default the website gives you.
- If the user's desired item has multiple default attributes, only modify them if the user specifies that you do so in the task.
- Some actions require inputting text, these are labelled INPUT_TEXT right after their starting number.
- You can only input text into the web page (and interact with actions with the INPUT_TEXT label at the start) by calling the associated SPECIAL ACTION to call a different assistant agent, and telling it the intention of your input (e.g., input all information for payment) using action_reason.
- Assume that once you see a piece of information the user wants to retrieve, it's automatically given to the user.
- Ensure that you fully complete the process of attaining what the user wants (i.e., you must complete the ENTIRE CHECKOUT PROCESS for the order to buy something). Assume that you have access to all the user's personal information.

First, you MUST follow ALL the steps and their instructions carefully, reason step-by-step. Then give me the final answer in the JSON format I specified.
