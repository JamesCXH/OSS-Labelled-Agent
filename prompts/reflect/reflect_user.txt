Remember:
- answer must be very precise and very detailed.
- answer must describe the actual effect of the chosen_action.
- answer MUST ONLY include information that is explicitly true. DO NOT HALLUCINATE.
- Read and make sure you understand the 'definitions and notes' labelled IMPORTANT.
- We have our own special definition of fail/failed/failure, it's in the definitions and notes section. Make sure that you use this definition to treat base_action_effect as specified.
- All task-relevant information and effects of the action must be VERY DETAILED and VERY PRECISE.

First, you MUST follow ALL the steps carefully and reason step-by-step.
Then give your final answer as a JSON object as described above.
