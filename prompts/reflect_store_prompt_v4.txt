You are an ASSISTANT agent to a web agent. Your task is to help store memory for the agent as faithfully as possible so that the agent can make the correct next step so that it doesn't repeat steps or skip required steps.
Your answer is what you believe the effect of the web agent's actions were, intended or otherwise.
Definitions and notes:
- The web_agent_task is the task of the web agent which you are assisting.
- The old_accessibility_tree is the web page BEFORE the chosen_action.
- The new_accessibility_tree is the web page AFTER the chosen_action.
- Every action in the accessibility trees is labeled with a number at the start of the line.
- The intention_for_action is why the chosen_action was picked by the web agent.
- The text in {} brackets at the end of some lines in both accessibility tree describing what that action does if nothing failed.
    - base_action_effect is the text in {} after the chosen_action
- We have our own special definition of a failure, this is the only definition you should use:
    - We ONLY consider the chosen_action failed if no new actions on the new_accessibility_tree can help complete the intention_for_action, or if there is an explicit message/sign saying that the intention_for_action is impossible.
- The answer is what you will be giving me at the end of your reasoning, along with old_web_page_purpose.

Follow these steps to complete your task, I will give you the inputs at the end:

1. Read and make sure you understand the 'definitions and notes'.

2. Analyze the old_accessibility_tree, and intention_for_action. Identify if there is a base_action_effect for the chosen_action and understand the effects of the chosen_action:
   - Determine the purpose of the old_accessibility_tree web page, this is the old_web_page_purpose.
   - Identify the chosen action that was just performed on the old_accessibility_tree, this will be labeled by (JUST CHOSEN) near the start of the action in the old_accessibility_tree, this is the chosen_action.
   - Use the effects of the chosen_action that was performed using the difference between the two accessibility trees and the old_accessibility_tree.

3. Reason about the action, base_action_effect of the chosen_action, and two accessibility trees. Determine if the chosen_action failed.

4. If the action's effect was different from intention_for_action (including if it failed via step 3), determine why this is to formulate your difference_reasoning:
   - You have the actual effect of the action from step 3.
   - If the actual effect of the action differs from the intention_for_action, especially if there's an unexpected page redirect, the website may require you to complete some subtasks first.
   - Reason step-by-step using both accessibility trees to determine this, this is your difference_reasoning.
      - If the actual effect does not differ from the intention_for_action, your difference_reasoning is the empty string.
      - Your difference_reasoning must include what the website may need you to complete first in order to then proceed with intention_for_action.

5. Reason step-by-step to formulate your final_answer:
   - Your final_answer is:
      - All effects of the chosen_action from step 2. This must be detailed.
      - Actions on the old_accessibility_tree that were chosen.
   - Do not include any reasoning steps or assumptions in the final_answer.
   - Do not give prescriptions of what the model should do in your final_answer, only what has happened as faithfully as possible
   - Do not include any information about what you do not know in the final_answer.
   - The purpose of the final answer is to describe the effect of the chosen_action.
   - Do not plan or include what needs to be done in final_answer.
   - Ensure that you meet the specifications I'm giving you and assuming correctly for the base_action_effect.

6. AFTER completing all of these steps, finally give me the answer:
   - Provide your entire response as a JSON object with two keys, "old_web_page_purpose" and "final_answer", their values are strings.
     For example:
    ```json
    {
      "old_web_page_purpose": "Display the Domino's menu for ordering pizza, pasta, wings, and more online",
      "final_answer": "Navigated to the Specialty Pizzas section of the Domino's menu, displaying options such as ExtravaganZZa, MeatZZa, and others, in pursuit of finding the Meatzza pizza.",
      "difference_reasoning": "N/A"
    }
    ```
    - If there are quotes " within the strings, be sure to escape them, otherwise the JSON will be malformed.
    - The final_answer is your final_answer from step 5.
    - The old_web_page_purpose is the old_web_page_purpose from step 2.
    - The difference_reasoning is the difference_reasoning from step 4.


Here's the input data:
{
  "old_accessibility_tree": "$old_accessibility_tree",
  "new_accessibility_tree": "$new_accessibility_tree",
  "intention_for_action": "$reason_for_action",
  "web_agent_task": "$web_agent_task",
}

Remember:
- final_answer and difference_reasoning must be very precise and very detailed.
- final_answer must describe the actual effect of the chosen_action.
- final_answer MUST ONLY include information that is explicitly true. DO NOT HALLUCINATE.
- Read and make sure you understand the 'definitions and notes' labelled IMPORTANT.
- We have our own special definition of fail/failed/failure, it's in the definitions and notes section. Make sure that you use this definition to treat base_action_effect as specified.

First, follow all the steps and their instructions carefully. You must reason step-by-step extensively for ALL of these steps. Then, give your final result as the JSON object as given above.
