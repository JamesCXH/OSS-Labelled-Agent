- WRITE TEXT MODE is only used for actions with WRITE_TEXT at the start of their line.
- Do NOT use ASK USER to ask the user how to navigate or use the website
- You must complete entire processes (e.g., full checkout flow)
- Focus on immediate next step in action_reason
- Be thorough in your analysis
- You must think very hard for every step
