Here's the input data in JSON format:
{
  "web_agent_task": "$web_agent_task",
  "world_memory": "$world_memory",
  "action_memory": "$action_memory"
}


Answer this set of questions (1-6) sequentially:

1. Break down the web_agent_task, and list out everything that the user desires individually. All of these desires are task-relevant.

2. Determine what has been done on the website for world_memory and action_memory separately:
   - You must include precise action descriptions about everything that has been completed.
   - The world_memory is a summary of everything the agent has experienced and done that is task-relevant. world_memory records from oldest to newest.
   - The world_memory was last updated BEFORE action_memory was recorded.
   - The action_memory is a list of all the actions that were performed AFTER the world_memory was last updated.
       - The action_memory is an enumerated list of tuples in the format:
           - x) Location: Where action was taken
             x) Effect: Effect of action
           - Later items in action_memory happened more recently.
       - Use the effect of the actions and their locations from action_memory to guide you.
       - action_memory records from oldest to newest, newer has higher numbering.
   - Both the world_memory and action_memory are very explicit and precise in language.
   - For each memory type, list what is definitely and explicitly true.
   - Do this for each memory type.

3. Given your analysis of world_memory and action_memory from step 2, integrate the information and determine everything that has been completed on the website:
   - List everything that you know is explicitly true in step 2.
   - If the action_memory states that something has been completed, assume its has been fully completed.
   - Again, action_memory describes the most recent set of actions that have been completed, after world_memory was last changed.

4. Formulate information that is definitely true from action_memory and world_memory to form new_world_memory.
   - You got all task-relevant information in step 1.
   - Use precise and exact wording which aligns with what's in new_world_memory and action_memory, note that the task-relevant information may not exactly match the user's desires.
   - The new_world_memory should keep track of:
       - The explicit completion of task-relevant operations.
       - Failures in attempts to navigate to or complete task-relevant subtasks, and the reasons for the failures.
       - Dead-ends in the website and its reasons
       - General navigation information ONLY for navigating to complete the next task-relevant subtask that needs to be completed.
   - Only include website location information when it concerns a dead-end or failure.
   - DO NOT include observational information that's not about a failure/dead-end.
   - Only include information that is explicit from step 3.
   - new_world_memory should record from oldest to newest.
   - Give me new_world_memory.

5. Remove successful intermediate navigation steps from the new_world_memory:
   - An intermediate step is a step between two completions of task-relevant subtasks. Remove information about successful intermediate navigation steps. Keep non-intermediate navigation steps.
   - Keep information about failures and dead-ends.
   - Be careful not to over-condense and assume something that's false or incorrect.
   - Use exact descriptors where they are true.

6. AFTER completing all of these steps, finally give me the new_world_memory:
   - Provide your entire response as a JSON object with a single key "new_world_memory" whose value is a string of the new_world_memory information.
     For example:
     {
       "new_world_memory": "Added three Pepperoni pizzas to cart"
     }
   - Ensure that your wording is the exact same as step 5.


Remember:
- Ensure the new_world_memory condenses all navigation information about COMPLETED task essential subtasks.
- The new_world_memory only serves to record what has been done.
- Do not plan or include what needs to be done in new_world_memory.
- You MUST include information about the COMPLETION of task-relevant operations.
- Task-relevant subtasks include specifications/tasks mentioned in the web_agent_task.
- new_world_memory must be very precise and very detailed about all information that is task-relevant.
- new_world_memory must ONLY include information you know is DEFINITELY true. DO NOT assume anything.
- new_world_memory must ONLY include information about tasks that were completed, is currently being completed, or failures.

First, you MUST follow ALL the steps and their instructions carefully, reason step-by-step.
Then give your final answer as a JSON object as described above.
